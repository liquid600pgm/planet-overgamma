This folder contains important development milestones of Planet Overgamma.
These are x86_64 ELF executables, compiled on my main development machine
running Fedora 30. This means that they will not work with old glibc versions.

Keep in mind that these individual versions are not documented, thus, the
directory structure may be different from version to version.
