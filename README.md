# Planet Overgamma
You crash on an overgrown planet. It seems like it's irradiated with some
unknown energy, which caused its primitive plant-like lifeforms to mutate and
grow all over the planet.

A platformer/survival hybrid, originally made for GitHub Game Off 2018.
You can find the game jam version [here](https://lqdev.itch.io/planet-overgamma-classic),
and its source code is available on the `classic` branch.

*Work in progress.*
