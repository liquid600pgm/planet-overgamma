# Planet Overgamma
You crash on an overgrown planet. It seems like it's irradiated with some unknown cosmic energy, which caused its
primitive plant-like lifeforms to mutate and grow all over the planet.

A platformer/survival hybrid for GitHub Game Off 2018.

This is the source code of the original, game jam version of the game, now called [Planet Overgamma Classic](https://lqdev.itch.io/planet-overgamma-classic). For the new source code, see the `rapid` branch.
